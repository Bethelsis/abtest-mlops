# SmartAd-Campaign


### Objective
Test if the ads that the advertising company runs resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness. Our task here, is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), which is a lightweight questionnaire served with every campaign.

### Data


The BIO data for this project is a “Yes” and “No” response of online users to the following question

Q: Do you know the brand SmartAd? O Yes O No The users that were presented with the questionnaire above were chosen according to the following rule:

* Control: users who have been shown a dummy ad 
* Exposed: users who have been shown a creative, an online interactive ad, with the SmartAd brand. The data is collected from 3-10 jul 2020 from SmartAd  advertising agency.

# This project is divided into four main sections:

   * Creating an A/B testing framework that includes traditional, sequential, and machine learning tests
   * Creating a repeatable machine learning framework
   * Using MLOps best practices, conduct A/B testing with classical, sequential, and machine learning methodologies.
   * Obtaining statistically valid insights in respect to the business goal

# what has been implemented

* Classical Type of A/B testing 
* Sequential A/B testing
* A/B testing with Machine Learning 
* DVC setup
* ML Framework Setup using CML


The notebooks in this repository contains data exploration and implementation of classical p-value based algorithm,the sequential A/B testing algorithm  and Machine learning based AB testing in Python.
